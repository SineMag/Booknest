## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](httpss://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later recommended)
- [npm](httpss://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js)

### Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    The server will start on `http://localhost:3000` (or the configured port).
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Open a new terminal** and navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd front-end
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    The React development server will start, typically on `http://localhost:5173`.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Once both servers are running, you can access the application in your web browser at the frontend URL.
